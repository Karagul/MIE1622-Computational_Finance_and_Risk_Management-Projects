## 1. Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection Strategies<br/>
The goal of optimization effort is to create a tool that allows the user to make regular decisions about re-balancing their portfolio and compare different investment strategies. 
1. Buy and Hold
2. Equally weighted
3. Minimum variance
4. Maximum Sharoe ratio

## 2. Risk-Based and Robust Portfolio Selection Strategies<br/>
Implement 3 new strategies:
1. Equal risk contributions
2. Leveraged equal risk contributions
3. Robust mean-variance optimization

## 3. Credit Risk Modeling and Simulation<br/>
Model a credit-risky portfolio of corporate bonds using Monte Carlo Simulation and True distribution.

## 4. Asset Pricing<br/>
Asset Pricing using:
1. Black-Scholes equation
2. Monte Carlo Simulation using Geometric Brownian Motion(GBM) with constrant drift "mu" and volatility "sigma".
